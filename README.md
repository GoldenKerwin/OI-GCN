# Different or Consistent? Graph Neural Network Enhanced by Opinion Interaction Representation Learning for Rumor Detection on Social Media

## Introduction

We introduce the **O**pinion **I**nteraction-enhanced **GCN** (OI-GCN), which integrates these interactions into the GCN learning process. By quantifying opinion interactions through element-wise multiplication of semantic vectors and designing two graph convolution operators, OI-GCN enriches node representations. Experiments on three datasets show OI-GCNâ€™s superior performance over existing methods, underscoring the importance of modeling opinion interactions for effective rumor detection.

## Requirement
We test the codes in the following environments, other versions may also be compatible:
+ PyTorch  2.1.2
+ Python  3.10
+ Cuda  11.8

## Get Started
```
$ bash main.sh

```
